# Hi

Thanks for coming to my Github.

All that is shown here are some fun apps I wrote a long time ago that I still laugh about the UX effort I went to when making it. 
Please do enjoy my extreme mode on tic tac toe and building Henry the Elf. 

All other code assignments are removed as they were obviously completed before I acquired my current job (over 1 year ago) and so they don't represent my current skills.

Any current projects I am working on are private because I have an entrepreneurial spirit! If I am writing quality code backed up by an amazing idea, I am not giving that away for free like some kind of start up template anyone can fork!

So, the best way to find out what I can do is to test me ;-) 

Check out my medium page for the occasional article I write discussing the software engineer career and helping brand new engineers get off to a good start!
